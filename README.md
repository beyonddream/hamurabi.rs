Hamurabi game in rust

I ported the original game from focal/basic to C. This is rust port of C.  
The C version is [here](https://github.com/beyonddream/hamurabi). 
For the original focal version look inside `doc/` directory.

For game play - check the C repo.

# Running

`cargo build` - for building the game.
`cargo run` - for running the game.
